# movie_map
3 layers are created on the map, namely:
1. The main layer of the map
2. Layer of placemarks and current user position
3. Coloring layer of countries.

Tags have a movie name and a full location name.
The last layer is determined by the number of shooting locations in a particular country (0 - gray, 1-3 - yellow, more - green.)
The last layer is selective, which had to be added by a third of the task.
